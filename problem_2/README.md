# Problem 2

## Part a
The `data_analysis.py` script performs some analysis on the `data.csv` data and prints out the result. This script, while delivering the desired result, is very poorly written and should be cleaned up and refactored. 
1. The goal is to rewrite the code in the original file and save it as `data_analysis_refactored.py` file. Is should run (`python3 data_analysis_refactored.py`) and print the exact same output as the `data_analysis.py` code.
2. Strive to deliver the most elegant and readable code you can.

The objective of this exercise is to test your code review/refactoring/styling abilities. We are not trying to be tricky and there are no known issues with this code. If something is confusing or appears wrong, please feel free to ask a question.

## Part b
Question: One might say that as long as code does the desired job, it is irrelevant how it is written. Please share your thoughts on why is it important to have your code be readable, simple, and clean. What makes code elegant and readable? Share your answer as a `question2.txt`.

Good Luck!
