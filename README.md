# Weclome to the Airspace Machine Learning Engineer Technical Screening 

At Airspace the AI team main language is Python. Each member of our team is highly proficient in Python and we expect the same from anyone who joins the team.

This screening consists of two problems which can be found in the `problem_1` and `problem_2` directories. Each exercise is designed to give us a taste of your coding skills and ability to think through problems. These problems should not be a large time investment. Please follow the guidelines below and feel free to ask any questions as needed.

1. The directions for each problem are in the `README.md` in each problem's directory.
2. These two problems are separate from each other and should be treated as such.
3. Please do not fork this repo.
4. Email back the following files: 
     *  Problem 1: `main.py`, `bonus.txt` (bonus is optional)
     *  Problem 2: `data_analysis_refactored.py`, `question2.txt`

Good luck!
