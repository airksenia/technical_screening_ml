## Technical screening for Machine Learning Engineer:

My name is Ksenia Palke - a data science manager at Airspace. I am excited that you made it to the technical screening in our hiring process. This little exercise intentionally gives very little data - I would like to get a taste of your coding skills and ability to think, rather than ask for a lot of time investment. 

The `order_records.log` file consists of json logs for each order, each having weight and volume, as well as an indication if the package information is either in imperial units (pounds and inches cubed) or not (kilograms and centimeters cubed), delivery/pickup zips, expense, company_id and driver type and a service_line of the order. 

The outcome of this project is very open ended. I want you to read, inspect and clean the data, develop any interesting or useful insights. You do not have to use all the fields, but pick an area of your focus. The methods you use are really up to you. The final deliverable could be a notebook containing your EDA, a simple machine learning model, etc.

Feel free to email me with any questions.
