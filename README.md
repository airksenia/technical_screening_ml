# Weclome to the Airspace Machine Learning Engineer Technical Screening 

This screening consists of two problems which can be found in the `problem_1` and `problem_2` directories. Each exercise is designed to give us a taste of your coding skills and ability to think through problems. These problems should not be a large time investment. Please follow the guidelines below and feel free to ask any questions as needed.

1. The directions for each problem are in the `README.md` in each problem's directory.
2. These two problems are seperate from each other and should be treated as such.
3. Each problem specifically states what is expected for the submission. Please email it back to us when ready.

Good luck!
